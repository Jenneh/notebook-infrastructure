# Reviewing Notebooks

All notebooks supported by STScI are expected to undergo some level of review to ensure they follow sustainable software practices and meet some learning goals for the users. In practice, this means most notebooks need both a "science review", focused on content, and a "technical review", focused on code, style, etc.  In practice these may be combined into a single review, although exactly how this is implemented depends on the specific repository, team, etc.  This document describes a "baseline" process meant to be flexible enough to apply to various repositories, as well as some of the CI and notebook review tools that make it easier.
