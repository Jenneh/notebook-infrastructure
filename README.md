# notebook-infrastructure

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/notebook-infrastructure/badge/?version=latest)](https://notebook-infrastructure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repository stores standards and software infrastructure for supporting Jupyter notebooks for public consumption at STScI.

The repository is divided into three core pieces:
* ``docs``: The written documentation of the instructure, review standareds, etc.
* ``notebook-repo-template``: The template used to create content repos.
* ``tools``: scripts or other software for managing repos that does not live in the template itself.
* Additional content-related material not in the above goes in the root of this repo.
